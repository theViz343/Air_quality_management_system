# Air_quality_management_system

## Aim
The project aims to develop a semi-automated air quality monitoring device that can alert the user on potentially dangerous situations and can take precautionary measures.

## Requirements
Libraries
* <DHT.h>
* <MQ2.h>
* <WiFi.h>

>**You can install the app on your device by downloading the apk from the repository and then installing it.**

>**A .aia file is also available if you want to view/modify the app's source code.**

Replace `Gangs of WiFipur` by WiFi name & `12345678` by WiFi password.

## Working
The device is based on the concept of a home automation system. It has temperature, humidity and various gas sensors. It gives information about the concentration of gases and temperature & humidity level to the administrator via an android app. It also notifies the user when levels increase above safe level and can take precautionary actions in dangerous situations according to need.
